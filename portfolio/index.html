          <h3>
            <span class="bold">Personalizable Display Frame</span> -- Internet of Things Picture Frame
          </h3>
          <p>
            Personalizable Display Frame was created by Karan Shah and myself at the behest of a
            third-party client during the course of EECS 347-I and II (Microprocessor System
            Projects) at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to create an Internet-enabled picture frame, similar to
            other products currently on the market, with an accompanying management web application.
            The key feature of our product is a design targeting usage in nonpersonal spaces such as
            a hotel room or a shared office-- users can add photos to the system via the application,
            and then have their personal photos displayed when appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user planning to stay in a hotel that utilizes the Personalizable
            Display Frame system could log into the application and upload a set of personal photos.
            When the time comes for the user's stay in the hotel, the hotel manager simply accesses
            the application and links the frame in the user's room to the user's profile. When the
            user enters the room, the frame will already be displaying their pictures. All the users
            need to do is add pictures, and all the managers need to do is choose which user's
            pictures to show.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used Amazon Web Services (specfically Elastic Cloud Compute and Relational Database
            Service) to host our application in order to practice utilizing cloud services and to
            simulate a system that could be easily expanded to larger scales as necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            We used the following technologies to implement our design:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Web Application
                <ul class="italic smallText">

          <h3>
            <span class="bold">Pan-Tilt-Zoom Webcam</span> -- Embedded Systems Webcam
          </h3>
          <p>
            Pan-Tilt-Zoom Webcam was created by Caleb Burton and myself during the course of EECS
            495 Engineering System Design I and II at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a WiFi-enabled embedded systems webcam with an
            accompanying web application for control and viewing, with additional emphasis placed
            on physical design. There are three key components of this design: the embedded webcam,
            the web application and server, and the custom 3D-printed zoom lens enclosure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The embedded webcam was created using an ATSAM4S8b microcontroller with an OV2640DS
            camera module and an AMW004 WiFi module, using a custom circular PCB design we created
            using Eagle PCB. The web application and server were hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3, using a
            NodeRED server for the back end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. We
            experimented with using both websockets and a RESTful style during the course of our
            project- our final code relies on HTTP POST to transfer images from the webcam to the
            remote server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The custom zoom enclosure was designed in Onshape CAD to accomodate the circular PCB and
            a third-party smartphone zoom lens. The PCB and base of the zoom lens sit in an
            interior tube with a servo motor mounted on the back. This motor manipulates the outer
            tube, which features two pressure screws that rotate the focus knob of the zoom lens
            as the servo arms rotate. A mounting post allows the design to be fixed to a third
            party pan-tilt servo base, providing three degrees of adjustment via the application.
          </p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            I created this website for a few reasons: to host a more comprehensive version of my
            resume, to showcase the projects I've worked on, and to practice my front-end web
            development skills (particularly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
          </p>
          <p>
            This website represents my first foray into responsive web design--while I've created
            HTML pages with CSS styling before, they were mostly simple webpages designed for
            desktop viewing. With this website I've been experimenting with adding custom stylings
            to create a unique and appropriate view for users on a variety of different screens.
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan to keep updating this website as I continue to expand my web development
            skillset, and as I continue work on my personal projects.

          <h3>
            <span class="bold">Custom Servo Motor</span> -- Mechatronics Project
          </h3>
          <p>
            This project was the capstone project for ME333 (Mechatronics) at Northwestern
            University. The goal of the project was to utilize a microcontroller system to transform
            a simple brushed DC motor into a 360&#176; servo motor capable of tracking complex
            waveforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project features a two-level feedback control system: an encoder feedback loop to
            align motor position, and a current feedback loop to adjust the power to the motor.
            The motor is controlled by a PIC32 microcontroller system with an external H-Bridge to
            translate PWM signals from the PIC into appropriate DC motor control signals and a
            current-sensor chip to read the current across the motor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The motor's encoder sends the motor arm's current position to the PIC, which compares
            the position to the desired set point and uses PID feedback control to subsequently
            demand the current required to reach the set point. The current feedback loop reads the
            current across the motor via the current sensor and uses PI feedback to adjust the duty
            cycle of the PIC's PWM output until the demanded current is acheived.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both feedback loops run on separate fixed-frequency interrupts. The program is designed
            to communicate with a Matlab client program that allows a user to test and control the
            motor. The motor can be given a set angle to rotate to or a waveform in the form of
            several angles to rotate between, as seen in the "Position Control" image. Because the
            system relies on feedback control, the motor is capable of operating as expected in any
            orientation and with a variety of different armbars attached to the motor shaft.

            <span class="bold">Custom VHDL Processor</span> -- Computer Architecture Project
          </h3>
          <p>
            This project was completed by Jason Glass and myself for EECS 361
            (Computer Architecture) at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to create a 32-bit reduced MIPS instruction set processor
            from scratch in VHDL. There were three main stages: building a custom Arithmetic-Logic
            Unit (ALU), building a custom single-cycle processor, and building a custom pipelined
            processor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processor was designed to utilize our custom ALU alongside the requisite control
            logic units, registers, etc. in order to read and execute a variety of binary
            machine-language programs. The design of our single-cycle processor and a couple of
            waveforms from the operation of said processor are included.
